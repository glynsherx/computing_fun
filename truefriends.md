true friends never leave you behind, they are honest in what the think of you and they would do anything for you.
then why do friends leave you? it means that they are not the right friend for you and we have to accept the fact that some people come and go, we dont get to make the decision
for them. Sometimes, people just don't click. True friends accept you for who you are and they help you correct your mistakes to make you a better person.
Take a look around you, do you have a true friend or friends?
